# Dockspacer for Mac OS X
![Dockspacer screenshot](img/dockspacer.png "Dockspacer screenshot")

This Terminal-level program creates empty items in your Dock that you can use as spacers in order to delimit logical groupings of items. For example, you may have Sublime Text 3 and TextWrangler in your Dock, sitting next to each other, and you want to separate them from other Dock items with spacers.

**Note**: This program does not remove any Dock items you create; you’ll need to remove unwanted Dock spacers manually.
