# Dockspacer for Mac OS X
![Dockspacer screenshot](img/dockspacer.png "Dockspacer screenshot")

This Terminal-level program creates empty items in your Dock that you can use as spacers in order to delimit logical groupings of items. For example, you may have Sublime Text 3 and TextWrangler in your Dock, sitting next to each other, and you want to separate them from other Dock items with spacers.

**Note**: This program does not remove any Dock items you create; you’ll need to remove unwanted Dock spacers manually.

## Installation
1. Download and unzip the `dockspacer-master.zip` file from the “Download ZIP” link
2. Open The Terminal and navigate to the unzipped folder
3. Run `dockspacer` from The Terminal:

     `$ ./dockspacer`

4. Your computer will flash when it’s done. This is the result of restarting the Dock, and is normal.
