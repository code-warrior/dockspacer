With the dockspacer program copied into the /usr/local/bin folder, open a Terminal session and type “dockspacer”, sans quotes. Simple instructions in The Terminal will follow.

If the folder /usr/local/bin doesn’t exist, make it:

    mkdir -p /usr/local/bin

Then dismount and remount the installer.
