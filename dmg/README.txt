If the folder /usr/local/bin doesn’t exist, create it:

    sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/bin

You can then try dragging the dockspacer program into the bin folder again.

With the dockspacer program copied into the /usr/local/bin folder, open a Terminal session and type “dockspacer”, sans quotes. Simple instructions in The Terminal will follow.
